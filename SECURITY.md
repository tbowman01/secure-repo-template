# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We maintain this template on a best‑effort basis.  Only the `main` branch receives security updates.  Forks derived from this template must integrate upstream changes themselves.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please open a [GitHub security advisory](https://github.com/tbowman01/secure-repo-template/security/advisories) or email the maintainers at <security@example.com>.  We will respond to valid reports within 7 days.

## Disclosure Policy

Please do not open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.  Responsible disclosure helps protect users until a fix can be released.  Once a vulnerability is addressed we will publish a summary in the repository CHANGELOG and credit the reporter if desired.
